 Previous simulations suggested that once the astronauts left on their voyage, there was a strong chance that they would begin to disconnect from mission control, reducing the number of situations they would report on. To confirm the results of previous simulations, namely the Mars-500 missions, the researchers carried out the two isolations using a mixed-gender, international crew. The missions were testing how participants communicated with mission control and how well they worked together to form a successful colony.
