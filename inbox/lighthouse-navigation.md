Lighthouses typically mark either dangerous waters or known points for navigational purposes or both.

Mariners can identify specific lighthouses by their rate of flashing, color, horn or bell, and by using a compass bearing, identify their location on a line extending out from the identified lighthouse. With two lights identified, and the use of a compass, a mariner can triangulate to find their approximate position.



Michael Cyr’s answer is a good one. Lighthouses mark the location of both navigational hazards and navigable channels, sending light signals to approaching or passing vessels. Often these signals are explained on charts, but if not they’ll always be in the printed “sailing instructions” for a particular area. Lights are different colors, frequencies, etc., and by observing them, mariners can get a good sense of where they are. For instance, on the western coast of India, in the state of Karnataka, there are about five lighthouses. Most of these mark rocky promontories, but two of them indicate the location of harbors. For instance, to enter Udupi harbor, you have to use a diagonal channel some distance north of the city of Udupi, and there’s a lighthouse to help you find it. Similarly, you need to follow a dredged channel to access the New Port of Mangalore, to the south of Udupi, but north of Mangalore City, and there’s a light to help you find that, too. Of course, many merchant vessels today would have fairly sophisticated navigational gear aboard, but mariners prefer a visual check, even if it’s redundant, to suddenly grounding an oil tanker on a sandbar. And, of course, there are hundreds of fishing vessels and smaller craft that may not have state-of-the-art equipment.
