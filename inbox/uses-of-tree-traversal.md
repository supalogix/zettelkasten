Pre-order: Used to create a copy of a tree. For example, if you want to create a replica of a tree, put the nodes in an array with a pre-order traversal. Then perform an Insert operation on a new tree for each value in the array. You will end up with a copy of your original tree.

In-order: : Used to get the values of the nodes in non-decreasing order in a BST.

Post-order: : Used to delete a tree from leaf to root
