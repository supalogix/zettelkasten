Do most companies who say they use Agile these days just do daily standups (sitting down) with demos at the end of each sprint, and nothing else like retros or planning poker? Are developers tired of Agile?
More common is Watergile, also known as Agilefail.

This is where you turn a project into short, inflexible, thoroughly pre-planned, forecasted and committed chunks.

Agile was originally an attempt to embrace the uncertainty of development, not a revenue stream for consultants. We all got lost and bamboozled along the way.

There is strong commercial pressure to make project deliveries predictable, repeatable and forecastable. That is all well and good. But we still lack the required crystal ball to guarantee that.

Agile was once nothing more than iterative development. A bit of design as you go. A little rough estimation of maybe when and how much. All that was helped by ‘shifting left’ things like testing, integration and deployment and user testing.

Many companies simply do not do that. Any of that.

Agile has become a rigid, inflexible process that must be followed even when the specifics are not delivering good outcomes. We set long deadlines. Commit to specific deliverables on each iteration. Insist that all ‘sprint commitments’ (say what?) are delivered, even if that means the dev team work late whilst the ‘scrum master’ is on the golf course.

Whatever is happening, it’s not the spirit of that original agile manifesto.
