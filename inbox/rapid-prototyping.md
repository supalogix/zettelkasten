Seven Benefits of Rapid Prototyping
Rapid prototyping has many benefits. In addition to being your fast track to product-market fit, rapid prototyping can help you with all of the following:

Quick Iterations Generate Progress
Rapid prototyping uses short cycles to quickly improve the core design, and it’s not unusual to see cycles as short as a few days or a week. In the earliest stages of low fidelity prototyping, the cycles could be even shorter than this.

In addition to improving the design quicker than other methodologies, the visible progress this provides helps to increase buy-in from the team of product designers and other stakeholders at an early stage. By getting this early buy-in from stakeholders, projects that use Rapid Prototyping benefit from increased stakeholder feedback compared to other methodologies.

Focus on Improving Core Features
Unless the project is very small, there isn’t time to prototype every single page, feature, or function. Instead, rapid prototyping forces the team to prioritize the small number of features that deliver the biggest impact for the project.

This focus ensures the time and resources are spent where they’ll have the biggest impact and avoids the design phase getting bogged down by minor details. Used properly, rapid prototyping should conform to the Pareto Principle, covering the 20% of features that deliver 80% of the impact.

Focuses Design on End-User
With its focus on end-user testing, rapid prototyping emphasizes usability and customer experience from the beginning of the project. This early feedback helps to refine the design and reduces the likelihood of the development becoming delayed due to requests for significant changes.

This means projects using rapid prototyping often lead to results that are closer to the customer’s initial intentions. This is especially true when compared to waterfall methods, which lack the opportunity for early end-user feedback.

Tests Key Customer Journeys
Interactive prototypes allow real users to test key customer journeys and provide feedback. For example, if you were building a banking app, it would be far cheaper to test common user interactions such as checking a balance, opening a new account, or finding mortgage information using a prototype. Prototypes enable businesses to spot key problems without wasting development time.

Encourages Collaboration and Feedback
Prototyping enables everyone involved with the project to collaborate and provide feedback. By giving stakeholders beyond the product design team, including end-users, early opportunities to interact with and comment on the product the finished product is more likely to meet expectations.

Reduces Project Risk
The low cost of prototyping compared to development means teams that use rapid prototyping reduce their project risk. Regular early feedback from end-users and stakeholders means problems that can derail the project are discovered and discussed before the business invests more funds.

If the team does find major problems, they can either fix them during the prototyping phase (which costs far fewer resources than fixing the same problem at the development stage) or abandon the project with relatively few resources wasted.

Reduced Time to Market
The use of iterative prototypes accelerates the speed at which you can develop an app. This speed means businesses may benefit from being first to market and the increased market share that comes with it.

By getting to market quicker, businesses start to recoup their development costs quicker, plus a quicker development is likely to cost less in labor.
