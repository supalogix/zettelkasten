Common business rules examples
Customer discount rules
Business rules are commonly used to offer customers discounts. For example, an organization may have a policy to give customers that spend $5,000 in a calendar year a discount on purchases once that threshold is reached. The rule could be: “If a customer spends more than $5,000 in any calendar year, then offer a 15% discount on each item.”

Subscription service auto-suspension
Subscription fee models are common in nearly every industry. Yet manually managing subscription billing and service eats away at your bottom line. To make it easy, may automate suspension of service for nonpayment. So, an organization could create a business rule that cancels service for any customer that fails to make a payment (i.e., more than 30 days past due).

Automated sales commissions
Many employees are compensated on a commission basis or awarded bonuses based on performance. To simplify the process, accounting might create a rule that: “If an employee sells more than $50,000 worth of products within a calendar year, he or she will be awarded a $5,000 bonus.” This rule ensures that an employee is paid as agreed without the need to manually track sales.

Assigning assets to new employees
Employee onboarding is a time-consuming process. Employees must be trained, granted system access, and assigned assets, among other things. An example of a common onboarding business rule might be that all new employees are assigned an email address. Credentials would be automatically created allowing the employee to access the system and choose a new password.

Home loan interest rate business rules
Banks are required to collect a lot of data when originating a mortgage, like information about the home being purchased and the borrower’s credit history. Business logic plays an important role in automating manual loan processes. For instance, a bank can specify a minimum credit score to qualify for a specific interest rate.

Suspicious transaction triggers
To mitigate fraud financial institutions rely on automation to flag suspicious transactions. With these rules, banks can specify charges that trigger authentication. For example, out-of-state credit card transactions over $1,000 could require that a representative contact the cardholder to verify the transaction.

Generating student ID numbers
Admissions Offices are also tasked with collecting and reviewing a lot of information. Business rules can help streamline the application process as well as enrollment. For example, once a student is accepted the system can automatically generate student ID numbers. Rules could determine both the prefix and the required number of characters.

Declined applications based on scores
Landlords and property management companies are tasked with reviewing rental applications. Creating rules to approve or reject applications can streamline the process. For instance, an organization could create a rule that declines a rental application for an applicant with a credit score lower than a specified threshold.

Auto calculating shipping rates
Clearly defining shipping rates helps organizations to provide good customer service and ensure that each sale is profitable. Business logic is commonly used to calculate rates. For example, “The basic rate is $2 per pound but is reduced to $1.50 per pound for excess over 10 pounds.”

Purchase requests by amount
Manual approval processes are inefficient and often lead to delays while employees chase down supervisors for signatures. With a BRMS, an organization might automatically approve purchase requests under a certain amount, say $2,000. For purchase requests over $2,000, the rule may require that the request is reviewed by a supervisor.
