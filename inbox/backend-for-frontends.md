One solution to this problem that I have seen in use at both REA and SoundCloud is that rather than have a general-purpose API backend, instead you have one backend per user experience - or as (ex-SoundClouder) Phil Cal√ßado called it a Backend For Frontend (BFF). Conceptually, you should think of the user-facing application as being two components - a client-side application living outside your perimeter, and a server-side component (the BFF) inside your perimeter.

The BFF is tightly coupled to a specific user experience, and will typically be maintained by the same team as the user interface, thereby making it easier to define and adapt the API as the UI requires, while also simplifying process of lining up release of both the client and server components.

So you can see your organisation structure as being one of the main drivers to which model makes the most sense (Conway's Law wins again).

As I have said many times before, I am fairly relaxed about duplicated code across services. Which is to say that while in a single process boundary I will typically do whatever I can to refactor out duplication into suitable abstractions, I don't have the same reaction when confronted by duplication across services. This is mostly as I am often more worried about the potential for extracting shared code to lead to tight coupling between services - something I am more worried about than duplication in general. That said, there are certainly cases where this is warranted.
