For starters: this point about the hands. Now, the way the Hegel-wife describes her husband making this point, it ends up sounding completely ridiculous — sure. A right hand is not a left hand: one's right hand is not identical to one's left hand. They are not, as the Hegel-wife correctly points out, superimposable.

But this is not what Hegel's doctrine of the unity of opposites actually entails. Rather, the point is that there are certain pairs of opposed concepts — like infinity and finitude, positive and negative, identity and difference, and of course left and right — where the one simply cannot be understood except somehow through the other. Thus, we cannot understand a left hand as a “left” hand, unless against a background where there also exist right hands, and vice versa.

Now, that might sound like a pretty trivial point, but it’s central to Hegel’s thought. This is because it's through the various tensions which emerge between these paired opposites that we get the whole movement of his thought: the dialectical development of his philosophical system from its starting point, “being, pure being” to nature, art, politics, and everything else. This relates to the idea that Hegel's thought is “presuppositionless” (in the Reddit text it says “presuppositional,” I think this is a typo).
