Machine learning is essentially concerned with extracting models from data, often (though
not exclusively) using them for the purpose of prediction. As such, it is inseparably connected with uncertainty. Indeed, learning in the sense of generalizing beyond the data seen
so far is necessarily based on a process of induction, i.e., replacing specifc observations
by general models of the data-generating process. Such models are never provably correct
but only hypothetical and therefore uncertain, and the same holds true for the predictions
produced by a model. In addition to the uncertainty inherent in inductive inference, other
sources of uncertainty exist, including incorrect model assumptions and noisy or imprecise
data.
